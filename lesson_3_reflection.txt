When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When working on multiple computers or with multiple collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So you can control when to get the changes, so that it doesn't interfere with what you're doing locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: creates a 'branch' that pulls from the original, but will not push back to the original
	Clone: creates a local copy and sets a connection to the original for pushing and pulling
	Branch: creates paths in a single repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can check for changes without an internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You would have to send files back and forth, with text describing what had changed.
	You would be able to collaborate using just email, without requiring GitHub accounts.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you don't want to affect or change the master branch until you are ready to do so.
